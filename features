TO ADD:

Memory - system asks your name
  next time user comes back it asks who it is speaking to
  will load appropriate answers based on user
  could potentially be used then to save times locations days etc

Better question / answer selection
  looser, less control, natural language

Functions
  have the system run functions on command, i.e. ask JPyBot to roll 1-6 using dice.py
  build more new functions for jpybot to interact with

APIs?
  do searches with google and other APIs to provide responses

  Potential APIs to investigate
    Weather
    Tv Shows?
    Blizzard

Hook this up to Wit.AI
  So that it can use Voice commands?
